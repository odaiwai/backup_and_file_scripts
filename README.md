# README

This repository is a collection of scripts I use to manage the backups of both the 
ext4 and btrfs filesystems on my Linux box.  

They are intended to be used by someone who knows what they're doing.  I take
no responbility for the outcome if you install these and unleash a plague,
riots, murder hornets, make Donald Trump president, or try to otherwise destroy
the world.
